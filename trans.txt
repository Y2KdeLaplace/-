Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Basic Physics & Brief History
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on
the physics principle of
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or NMR
first described in the 1930s and 40s
The basic principle of NMR deals with
the interaction of certain atomic nuclei
radio frequency energy
and a strong magnetic field
This is a tough concept to grasp
so for comprehension purposes
We'll start with the basics
First a few definitions...
Radio frequency energy is part
of the electromagnetic spectrum
that includes visible light and X-rays
As you can see
the radio frequencies are at the far left of the spectrum
visible light in the middle
and X-rays to the right
All of these waves are defined by
a  wavelength and frequency
The wavelength is the distance
between peaks of the wave
and the frequency is how many cycles
are completed every second
The Amplitude is the height or power of the wave
When talking about two or more waves
we can also describe a Phase
The blue and orange waves on the screen
have the same frequency
and line up completely so they are also in phase
If we shift the orange wave to the right
the frequency remains the same
but the waves are now out of phase
or have been phase shifted
On the other hand these two waves have
different frequencies but start
at the same time so they are in phase
For the purpose of NMR and MRI
radio frequency signals will be
described by their unique Phase and Frequency
A point on this computer screen is
called a pixel
a concatenation of the words picture & element
MR images are made up of a series a Voxels
or volume elements
Each square on the picture corresponds to a
volume of tissue on the body
The MR machine is designed to measure the NMR signal
from each of the small volumes, localize them in 3D space
and plot them on a 256 by 256
or 512 by 512 matrix to make a visible picture
With this in mind we'll first describe the principles
of NMR in a single small square or box of tissue
I suspect most of us have some recollection
of constructing an electromagnet as a kid
utilizing a common battery a switch
an iron nail and a coil of wire
Throw the switch, pick up some small steel balls
and consider yourself a mad scientist. Great stuff!
What we unknowingly demonstrated with that simple project
was the basic principle of Electromagnetism
where a flowing current electrons
has an associated magnetic field
oriented 90 degrees from the direction of current flow
The battery pushes the electrons around the wire
We coil the wire to add up all those little magnetic moments
and add the steel nail to conduct the magnetic field to the
object we want to pick up
The direction of the magnetic field associated with
the coill is defined by the right hand rule
Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction
of the current flow through the coil
and your outstretched thumb will  point at the direction of
the associated magnetic field
With that in mind
let's look at the simplest of all elementsâ€”Hydrogen
The Hydrogen atom consists of a single proton
in the nucleus with a single circulating electron
orbiting around that proton
for the principal of NMR
we don't care much about the electron
We're  interested only in that single central proton
or nucleus  hence the descriptor nuclear
in the acronym NMR
That unopposed proton in the nucleus just doesn't sit
statically in the centre of the atom
It actually rotates on its axis similar to the planets and stars
Because the proton is positively charged
If we curl our fingers in the direction of rotation
our thumb'll point in the direction of the small magnetic field
associated with the each and everyone at the hydrogen protons
or spins in our body
and fortunately for imaging purposes we have
a lot of hydrogen atoms in our bodies
An adult is about 60 percent water which contains
two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen
The energy storing molecules of fat and carbohydrates
also contain an abundance of hydrogen with glucose sporting
12 hydrogens on a carbon oxygen hexagonal backbone
and the free fatty acid containing 2-3 hydrogens
attached to every atom of the linear
or branched chain carbon backbone
Now, while we're walking around the earth,
all of these little proton magnets or spins are randomly oriented
cancelling each other out and therefore
we're usually not magnetic. However
when we put any of us in a strong magnetic field
such as the one found in a standard MRI machine
all of these little spins or proton magnets lineup
Most of them line up with the main magnetic field
a few line up directly opposite
the main magnetic field and nothing in between
What determines the orientation is the amount of energy
associated with each of the individual atoms or protons
The ones with a little extra energy possibly
from some local increased heat
will line up against the main magnetic field
and therefore are considered to be in a high-energy state
the ones lining up with the main magnetic field
are in a low energy state
These protons don't simply point with
or against the main magnetic field
They actually precess much like a spinning top
as it falls to the solid surface
The rate of precession can be determined exactly by
the Larmor frequency equation
which states that the rate of rotation is directly
proportional to the strength of the local magnetic field
At 1 Tesla, the Larmor frequency of a hydrogen proton
or spin is 42.58 megahertz
At 2 Tesla, 85.16 megahertz
and at 3 Tesla 127.74 megahertz
or basically 42.58 megahertz per Tesla
This will be important when we're talking about
making an image from NMR data later on
For demonstration purposes
let's move all of our precessing protons
to a common origin on a 3D graph
As before, most of the protons are in a low energy state
pointing in the direction of the main magnetic field
a few energetic protons are oriented
against the main magnetic field in the high-energy state
Even though each proton is precessing in space
when you cancel all the opposing vectors
you end up with a net magnetization
pointing with the large main external magnetic field
as demonstrated in the simplified diagram on the right
This is called the longitudinal magnetization
Because it is in the same direction
as the large main external magnetic field
it cannot be measured or detected directly
and is therefore inferred.  But we can change all that.
Let's see what happens when we put energy
into the spins or protons
assuming our protons are sitting in a homogeneous
1 Testla field
the Larmor equation states that the precession rate
of these spins is 42.58 megahertz
if we transmit a radio frequency pulse of exactly
42.58 megahertz in the vicinity of the protons
two things happen
To make this a little easier to see
we're going to stop the precession
of the protons for a moment
First, the protons will absorb that energy and flip
the spins into the higher energy state
If we put in enough energy to push 50 percent
of the proton population into the high state,
in our case 4 up and 4 down
you can see our longitudinal magnetization reduces to 0
as the opposing magnetic forces cancel each other out
In addition, the sinusoidal radio frequency pushes
the protons to synchronize and spin together
This is the Resonance portion of an NMR
if we add up all the magnetic moment
you can see that we now have a net magnetic force
oriented horizontally or 90 degrees
to the longitudinal magnetization
this is called the Transverse Magnetization
and this magnetization can be detected
with a coil or antenna.
Just as a current can create a magnet
a magnet can create a current
If we have a coil of wire
connected to an ammeter or current meter
and we place a magnet through the coil
we will generate an electrical current through the wire
when we pull the magnet back
the current flows in the opposite direction
if we spin the magnet we generate a sinusoidal or
alternating electrical current- the basis of a generator
Similarly, the transverse magnetization rotates around
as the protons precess and generates a small
but measurable current in a regional coil of wire
This is the result we're looking for in nuclear
magnetic resonance but it's still not the whole story
After we remove the radio frequency signal
the protons will relax back into their baseline position
Again for demonstration purposes
we'll temporarily stop the precession
the first thing that happens is the protons or spins,
being all positively charged,
will repel each other and move apart
as they spread apart we lose that transverse magnetization
This process is called the T2 or Spin-Spin Relaxation
because it has to do with the interaction
of the protons or spins themselves
No net energy transfer occurs with this relaxation
The other relaxation occurs as the high-energy protons
fall back into the low energy state
As this happens, the energy that was previously absorbed
by the protons is dissipated into the surrounding tissues
in the form of heat and thus
involves an actual transfer of energy
As these protons fall back down to baseline,
we regrow the longitudinal magnetization
This is referred to as the T1 or Spin-Lattice Relaxation
because it involves the transfer energy from the spins
to the surrounding tissues or lattice
Putting this all together
a sufficient radio frequency pulse
tuned to the natural precession frequency
of the precessing protons
is put into the tissues to flip 50 percent of the spins
into the high-energy state and cause the protons
to synchronize in phase or spin together
thus moving the longitudinal magnetization
90 derees into the transverse plane
The transverse magnetization, precessing
at the resonant frequency of the local protons
produces a radio signal of the same frequency
that can be detected by a coil of wire
As the energy is removed,  the protons first move apart
in a T2 or Spin-Spin Relaxation
destroying the transverse magnetization
And then, through T1 or spin lattice relaxation,
fall back into the lower energy state
dissipating the previously absorbed energy
into the surrounding tissues in the form of heat
while regrowing or restoring 
the original longitudinal magnetization
Because these protons in our bodies
have different local environment,
some associate with the free-flowing water molecules
while others are fixed in position associated with the structural
or energy storing molecules of protein and fat,
they have characteristic differences in their T1 and T2 relaxations
We can accentuate and measure these differences
by changing how quickly we put
in the radio frequency energy
or the Repetition Time designated TR
and how quickly we choose to listen to the signal
coming back from the transverse magnetization
or Echo Time designated TE of the precessing protons
This process is referred to as the Pulse Sequence
and we will use a sample of fat and water
to demonstrate these differences
As before to simplify and maximize comprehension
we're going to stop the precession of the protons
On the left is a group of spins or protons
associated with fat and on the right, water
When we put in our resonant radio frequency Pulse,
all the protons absorbed that energy,
flip into the high-energy state
and spin together to produce a 90 degree Pulse
or transverse magnetization
If we wait a sufficient amount of time,
the protons will move apart in a T2 or Spin-Spin Relaxation
and the transverse magnetization will decay
The protons associate with the free fatty acids,
being relatively fixed in position, decay rapidly
as the spins push away from one another
They also give up their absorbed energy
more rapidly as they fall back to base line
in a T1 or spin-lattice relaxation,
depositing heat energy into the surrounding tissues
and regrowing the longitudinal magnetization
on the other hand
the protons in the freely flowing water
can hold on to their energy and
continue to spin together in phase
maintaining the transverse magnetization
At this point, when we turn on our receiving coil
and measure the signal coming back from the protons
the relatively large transverse magnetization in water
will give a strong signal   while the smaller or
absent transverse magnetization in fat
will give a weak signal
by convention, the strong water signal
will be assigned a grayscale color of white
and the weak signal of fat will be dark gray or black
Hence, to accentuate the different T2 relaxations
of the protons in our bodies
we would wait a long period between radio pulses
referred to as a long repetition time TR
and wait a long time to listen for the return signal or
echo referred to as a long echo time TE
And these differences can be measured and recorded
Using the same tissues in their baseline state
to accentuate the differences in T1 relaxations
we again put in a 90-degree resonance radio frequency pulse
which flips the protons into the high-energy state
and pushes them in phase
to produce our transverse magnetization
T2 relaxation occurs as the protons move apart-
faster in fat then water
and then the protons fall back into the low energy state
dissipating the absorbed energy as heat
into the surrounding tissues
and regrowing the longitudinal magnetization
Again, because the protons in water
are fluid and move freely
they tend to hold on to that energy longer
and the protons stay in the higher energy state
with little regrowth of the longitudinal magnetization
whereas the tightly bound fat protons
more rapidly give up that energy
and return to the lower energy state
rapidly regrowing the longitudinal magnetization
If we then quickly put in another resonant
90-degree radio frequency pulse,
the fully recovered fat protons will produce a large
transverse magnetization and a strong measured signal
that we can record if we listen to the return signal
or echo shortly after the second radio frequency pulse
However
the water protons are still in a high-energy state
with little regrowth of the longitudinal magnetization
Therefore the new radio frequency pulse pushes more of
the low energy protons into the high-energy state
and can only produce a small transverse magnetization
as well as a net longitudinal magnetization
oriented 180 degrees
or directly opposite the main magnetic field
This configuration in the water protons
will give a low amplitude or low energy way
when we listen for the echo or return signal
in other words
the protons in the water are saturated with energy and
can no longer produce a strong transverse magnetization
therefore to accentuate the differences
in the T1 relaxation between the protons in fat and water
we want to rapidly put in our
resonance radio frequency pulses
or a short repetition time TR
and quickly listen for the return signal
or short echo time TE
Now this is a difficult concept and you
may have to listen to it a few times to get it to sink in
but to summarize, the T1 relaxation effects
are accentuated by rapidly exposing the protons
to radiofrequency energy
and keeping the spins in the high energy state
and thus reducing the effective longitudinal magnetization
tissues that recover quickly will have a large signal
although slow to recover will have a low signal
T2 effects on the other hand are accentuated
by a prolonged echo time to allow the spins
to move away from each other
and accentuate the differences in T2 relaxation
between regional tissues or chemicals
so a T2-weighted image
is obtained with a pulse sequence of a long TR
and a long TE decreasing the T1 affect
along TR and enhancing the T2 affect with along TE
a T1-weighted image on the other hand
is obtained with a pulse sequence of a short TR
in a short TE enhancing the T1 relaxation
and minimizing the T2 affects
in between these two is the proton density Pulse sequence
which is obtained with a long TR and a short TE
effectively minimizing the T1 and T2 affect
and basically giving us an idea of the absolute number
or density of protons in the region
the first to propose the use of NMR
to diagnose disease in humans was Dr. Raymond Damadian
who in the March 1971 addition of the journal Science
published a short article entitled
Tumor Detection by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
in what he suggested that the NMR signal
from tumors in the body
could be differentiated from normal tissues
and therefore could be detected
his original concept was not to make an anatomic picture
but to build a detector large enough to accommodate a human
perform a whole body NMR
and look for a characteristic T1 and T2 tumor signal
that would suggest you have a malignancy somewhere
in your body sort of a quick screening tool for malignancy
while Dr.Damadian's tumor detector never came to fruition
we do use MR Spectroscopy in conjunction with a standard
MR image to help distinguish benign
from malignant processes in the body
to make an NMR picture here
MRI as we know it today we have to be able to localize
the signals coming from the sample or tissues in 3D space
the first to propose a technique to do just that
was Dr. Paul Lauterbur
in the March 19, 1973 addition of nature
Lauterbur published a brief article entitled
Image formation by induced local interactions
examples employing nuclear magnetic resonance
In the article he describes a technique
using magnetic radiance to identify the location of
two 1-millimeter capillary tubes filled with water
both of which were submerged in a larger
4.2 millimeter tube filled with heavy water
Heavy water has the symbol D2O
because the hydrogen atoms in heavy water
are isotopes of the standard Protium configuration
with one proton in the nucleus
the deuterium atom on the other hand contains a neutron
as well as the proton which limits the spin of the nucleus
and therefore does not give a good NMR signal
Lauterbur placed the apparatus in high field NMR Magnet shown
and developed a technique to identify the actual orgin
of the NMR signals from the standard water
this is the image produced
very primitive by today's standards
but clearly shows the location of the two capillary
tubes of  substandard water
lot ever called his technique Zeugmatography
from the Greek Zeugma which means
"that which is used for joining"
to show you how we make an actual MR picture
we're going to move our perspective of our spins
from the side to the top
and represent each grouping simply by
the net magnetic field rotating around the axis
remember that the Larmor or resonant frequency of our spins
is determined by the strength of the local magnetic field
when we first get into the MRI machine
a superconducting magnet creates
a near homogeneous magnetic field
from one side to the other
that determines the strength of MRI machine
common systems are 1
1.5 and 3 Tesla in strength
there are 3 sets of gradient magnets in the MRI
used to localize signals in 3D space
the Z-axis
X-axis, and Y-axis
to select a particular slice of tissue in the body
we can turn on the set of electromagnets along the z-axis
that create a magnetic gradient from head to toe
we now put in a radio pulse
with the frequency that will cause
the desired area to resonate as described earlier
we have now selected our slice to the body
because the local magnetic gradient is homogeneous
all of these net magnetic moment in a slice
are in phase spinning together in sync
and can't be distinguished from one another
to further localised these magnetic moments
in their signal strength we have two more gradients
that we can use to isolate the source of the signals
the first gradient is called the phase encoding gradient
to demonstrate the effect
we're going to slow down our net magnetic moments
the phase encoding gradient is briefly turned on
creating a gradient along the Y-axis in this particular case
resulting in the magnetic moments
at the bottom of the gradient to slow down
and the ones at the top
where the local magnetic field is stronger to speed up
the gradiient is quickly turned off
and the spinning magnets return to the base frequency
spinning at the same rate
but they have now experienced a phase shift in the Y-axis
which we can use to localize the spins in the Y-direction
we then tune our system to focus on a particular phase in the matrix
and use our third gradient to the X-direction
to definitively localized each of the signals
in the selected row
this gradient again causes the spins
to the right to slow down
and the ones on the left to speed up
this frequency encoding gradient remains on
while the signals are recorded
now each of the signals has a unique phase  and frequency
which can be localized in 3D space
the whole process is repeated for each row
localizing, in this example
in the Y-direction with the phase encoding gradient
and in the X-direction with the frequency encoding gradient
until the entire matrix is complete
each of the squares or voxels
are assigned a grayscale value
corresponding to the strength of the local signal
by convention, white being a strong signal
and black being no signal at all
in this simplified example
our 4 by 4 matrix doesn't look like much
but a standard MRI with a 256 by 256 or 512 by 512 matrix
will provide exquisite in anatomic detail of the body

Good Luck with Science Fair
